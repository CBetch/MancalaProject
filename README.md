# MancalaProject
This project implements a full simulation environment for the game Mancala, including:

A complete game engine

A Minimax AI with adjustable lookahead depth

A batch simulator that plays large numbers of games

A Jupyter Notebook Scratchpad for experiments, graphs, and analysis

This setup is used to test how AI depth affects performance (e.g., 2-ply vs 5-ply vs 10-ply).
